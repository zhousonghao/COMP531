What did you hope to learn but did not?
- I would love to learn something more about integrated web games

What did you really enjoy learning about?
- I enjoyed learning the whole procedure to develop a website from scratch

What worked well in the course? and how?
- The structure of the course is well defined besides it's a little pacy.

What did not work well in the course and how might it be improved?
- The pace could be a little slower since it is a lot to absorb.

What could I have done to help you more, presentation of material, design of in class
exercises, goals of projects â€“ and be specific please!
- it would be helpful if you could talk a little bit slower :)
